Feature: Admin Event Management
  As a logged-in admin
  I want to be able to add, edit, and delete events
  So that I can directly manipulate what events students see

  Background:
    Given I logged in as a "Admin"
    And I am on the admins page

  Scenario: Viewing the list of events
    When I visit the admin_events page
